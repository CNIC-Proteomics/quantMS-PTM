# Build in Singularity

```
cd buildments/
```

Building containers from SingularityCE definition files
```
cd search_engine
sudo  singularity  build  ../../../docker/build/nextflow/singularity/search_engine.sif   search_engine.def

cd ptm-compass
sudo  singularity  build  ../../../docker/build/nextflow/singularity/ptm-compass.sif  ptm-compass/ptm-compass.def
```


Building container in sandbox from SingularityCE definition files
```
cd search_engine
sudo  singularity  build  --sandbox  /tmp/search_engine    search_engine.def

cd ptm-compass
sudo  singularity  build  --sandbox  /tmp/ptm-compass  ptm-compass.def
```

You can build into the same sandbox container multiple times (though the results may be unpredictable, and under most circumstances, it would be preferable to delete your container and start from scratch):
```
cd search_engine
sudo singularity  build  --update  --sandbox  /tmp/search_engine  search_engine.def

cd ptm-compass
sudo singularity  build  --update  --sandbox  /tmp/ptm-compass  ptm-compass/ptm-compass.def
```


In this case, we're running singularity build with sudo because installing software with apt-get, as in the %post section, requires the root privileges.

By default, when you run SingularityCE, you are the same user inside the container as on the host machine. Using sudo on the host, to acquire root privileges, ensures we can use apt-get as root inside the container.

Using a fake root (for non-admin users)
```
singularity build --fakeroot ptm_compass.sif ptm_compass.def
```


# Interacting with images: Shell
The shell command allows you to spawn a new shell within your container and interact with it as though it were a virtual machine.

```
singularity shell search_engine.sif

singularity shell ptm-compass.sif
```

Enable to write in folder container (sandbox)
```
sudo singularity shell --writable /tmp/search_engine

sudo singularity shell --writable /tmp/ptm-compass
```

Enable to write in file container
```
sudo singularity shell --writable-tmpfs search_engine.sif

sudo singularity shell --writable-tmpfs ptm-compass.sif
```

Bind disk
```
singularity shell --bind /mnt/tierra:/mnt/tierra search_engine.sif

singularity shell --bind /mnt/tierra:/mnt/tierra ptm-compass.sif
```


# Open the repositories (shifts and solver) using the Visual Studio Code:
```
code /home/jmrodriguezc/solver/usr/local/shifts_v4/
```

# Executing Commands
The *exec* command allows you to execute a custom command within a container by specifying the image file.

```
singularity exec -w solver python /usr/local/shifts_v4/SHIFTSadapter.py 
```


```
singularity exec --bind /mnt/tierra:/mnt/tierra solver python /usr/local/shifts_v4/SHIFTSadapter.py \
